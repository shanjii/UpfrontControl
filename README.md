A button box app for flight simulators created with responsiveness and ease of use in mind.
The main goal of the app is to recreate a variety of preset UFC/ICP layouts for various aircraft in a way that feels satisfying and convenient for touch screen devices.

The app contains easily customizable keybinds and integration with [vJoy](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy), using responsive button layouts that can fit any type of device with the goal of maximizing screen real estate, as well as a variety of quality of life features that are useful for a mobile button box, including customizable haptics for button presses, audio clicks and auto screen fade to prevent burn-in on OLED screens.

## Integrations with vJoy

The app can communicate with vJoy (thanks to [bobhelander](https://github.com/bobhelander)'s [vJoy.Wrapper](https://github.com/bobhelander/vJoy.Wrapper)), this makes it possible to become it's own input device independent from the keyboard bindings. This also turns it into a plug and play device without the need for additional keybinds, since each aircraft preset contains its own vJoy bindings preconfigured without the need of further bindings.
Keyboard bindings can still be used and customized if preferred by disabling vJoy in the settings menu.

**You must have vJoy installed in your machine and properly setup to make use of the vJoy integrations**

## Setup

Setup guide pending.

**Requires the [ICPServer](https://github.com/shanjii/ICPServer) to be installed**, a server client that allows ICPApp to communicate with your computer.
